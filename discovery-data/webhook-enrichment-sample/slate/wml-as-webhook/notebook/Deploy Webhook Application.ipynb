Each of our brands ended the year stronger than it began, and aggressive and proactive initiatives across the organization led to new milestones in profitability. We are pleased with the progress we made in merchandising, marketing, customer acquisition and customer service, as it was these initiatives that we believe have allowed us to attract new customers to our brands and gain profitable market share all year. In fiscal 2010, our net revenues increased 12.9% to $3,504,158,000 compared to $3,102,704,000 in fiscal 2009 and we increased our fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share to $1.83 versus $0.72 in fiscal 2009. We also ended the year with $628,403,000 in cash after returning nearly $185,000,000 to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.\\r\\rIn our direct-to-customer channel, net revenues in fiscal 2010 increased by $227,902,000, or 18.6%, compared to fiscal 2009. This increase was driven by 26.9% growth in Internet net revenues in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Increased net revenues during fiscal 2010 were driven by the Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen brands.\\r\\rRetail net revenues in fiscal 2010 increased by $173,552,000, or 9.2%, compared to fiscal 2009. This increase was driven by growth of 9.8% in comparable store sales, partially offset by a 4.1% year-over-year reduction in retail leased square footage, including 18 net fewer stores. Increased net revenues during fiscal 2010 were driven by the Pottery Barn, West Elm and Williams-Sonoma brands.\\r\\rIn our core brands, net revenues increased 12.3% compared to fiscal 2009 led by growth in the Pottery Barn brand. Sales trends improved in every concept and we saw significant growth in new customer acquisition.\\r\\rIn our emerging brands, net revenues increased 17.1% led by West Elm and PBteen, which continued to see net revenue and operating margin increases. In Williams-Sonoma Home, we completed the retail restructuring of the brand by closing all stand-alone retail stores.\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"id":"755e9c846985474e88e45921b185205e"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{\n","  \"mentions\": [\n","    {\n","      \"span\":
