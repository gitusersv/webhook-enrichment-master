Technology - latimes.com,"Facebook Inc.'s latest capitulation to offended users offered another reminder of the social network's power for self-criticism.The Palo Alto company rescinded a controversial change to its terms of use late Tuesday after thousands of members protested that Facebook was claiming ownership of all photos and other material posted to the site.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said that wasn't the intention. But Facebook reverted to a previous version of its legal user guidelines that didn't include the disputed clause. Zuckerberg said the company would work to revise the policies, which Facebook calls its 'governing document,' with feedback from its 175 million users.'Given its importance, we need to make sure the terms reflect the principles and values of the people using the service,' he wrote on Facebook's corporate blog. 'Since this will be the governing document that we'll all live by, Facebook users will have a lot of input in crafting these terms.'The company is no stranger to controversy. It has faced strong user backlash to features including Beacon, its advertising service, and News Feed, its system for tracking and broadcasting users' moves to their online friends.In this case, users weren't content to hand Facebook the rights to their personal data. They also were unsatisfied by a Zuckerberg blog post Monday that many thought amounted to 'just trust us.' Users carried out their protests on the website, using the tools Facebook provides for posting blog entries and rallying around causes.Zuckerberg has compared the website to a nation, saying that its user base would make Facebook the world's sixth most populous country.This week's dissent was akin to that of a political protest. But Facebook took the state analogy to a new level, creating an online group called the Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities that it's using to collect suggestions from users. When they logged in late Tuesday and Wednesday, Facebook members were alerted to the changes and directed to the group page.'Facebook doesn't claim rights to any of your photos or other content,' the page says. 'We need a license in order to help you share information with your friends, but we don't claim to own your information.'Now Facebook is going back to the drawing board to craft a less divisive set of terms of service. The company will put together a more approachable document with less formal language, Zuckerberg wrote on the blog.'They need to have two-way conversations with their users about their terms of service and not just talk to the lawyers,' said Steven Swimmer, a social media consultant in Los Angeles. 'I thought their response was excellent.'It remains to be seen how many of the suggestions actually factor in to the new terms of service.'There is a kind of deceptiveness to the way this thing happened and the way it was pulled back,' said Harry Lewis, a computer science professor at Harvard University. 'People will have legitimate suspicions until they see the result.'The Consumerist, a blog run by watchdog group Consumers Union, uncovered the initial change to the terms Sunday, thanks to a tip e-mailed by a reader. Chris Walters, the writer of that blog post, applauded the decision to listen to user comments.Mina Kim, an actress in Los Angeles, said the flap was a wake-up call about the risks of posting personal data to the Web.'It makes you think about how these terms can be changed at any time,' she said. 'Maybe right now we own our photos, but what's going to stop Facebook from changing that down the line?'"
Technology - macworld.com,"In what the company has said will be its last Macworld Expo keynote ever, Apple on Tuesday announced updates to its iLife and iWork suites while unveiling a 17-inch MacBook Pro that now mirrors the unibody design of the rest of Apple's laptop line.Related Macworld Expo ArticlesExpo: Microsoft to enhance Entourage Exchange, SharePoint on the Mac Summary: Software, MacBook Pro updates star in final Apple keynote Expo: 17-inch MacBook Pro gets unibody makeover Expo: Apple adds productivity features to iWork Expo: Apple introduces iLife '09 Tuesday's keynote was delivered by Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, instead of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Apple announced last month that Jobs would not deliver this year's keynote and that the company would not attend future Macworld Expos. Whether it was Jobs' absence from the keynote stage or Apple's ambivalence about the annual Mac trade event, this year's keynote lacked a major product introduction like the 2008 unveiling of the ultra-thin MacBook Air laptop or the iPhone's memorable debut in 2007.Instead, Schiller focused largely on updating existing products. His 98-minute keynote led off with iLife '09, the latest version of Apple's suite of digital lifestyle applications. Highlighting the changes to the iPhoto photo management and editing application are Faces and Places tools for organizing photos around people and locations, respectively. The Faces feature uses facial-recognition technology to identify the faces of people in the photos you take. iPhoto '09 also adds integration with the Facebook and Flickr social networking sites.iLife '09 also includes updates to iMovie, which adds an expanded timeline view for advanced users as well as automatic video stabilization, and GarageBand, which focuses on video tutorialsWhile iLife '09 won't ship until the end of the month, the newly updated iWork suite of productivity applications is available now. All three components'the Keynote presentation application, the Pages writing and page-layout offering, and the Numbers spreadsheet tool'get new features. Apple also launched a new service, iWork.com, that lets users share and collaborate with documents online. The service is integrated into iWork '09 as a button in the toolbar of each application. iWork.com launched Tuesday a public beta.Both iLife and iWork sell for $79, with Family Packs of each suite available for $99. Apple is also bundling the two suites with Leopard and selling them as part of a $169 Mac Box Set. The bundle will be available in late January when iLife ships.In hardware news, Schiller unveiled a new 17-inch MacBook Pro model that replicates the unibody enclosure introduced to the rest of the laptop line in October. The unibody enclosure features a number of environmental improvements that Schiller touted during his keynote.The 17-inch MacBook Pro features a 2.66GHz Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB of memory, 320GB of storage, and Nvidia GeForce 9400M and GeForce 9600MT graphics. The system costs $2,799 and will ship by the end of January.The new MacBook Pro introduces a new kind of battery: one that isn't removable. Instead of the standard cylindrical AA cells "

Technology - news.cnet.com,"The iPhone developer behind Podcaster has found a way to get into Apple's App Store without invoking the wrath of iPhone Inspector No. 5.The developer, who has a private Blogger profile but appears to go by Alex according to Uneasy Silence, has a new application called RSS Player that duplicates the basic function of Podcaster--letting you download podcasts to your iPhone or iPod Touch--but without some of the features that Apple appears to have disliked. For example, you can't search for podcasts through the app, you have to subscribe to the RSS feed for those podcasts.Back in September, Apple rejected an iPhone application called Podcaster that allowed you to search for podcasts and download them to your device, which was a feature Apple later added to the iPhone. That was one of the first rejected apps to highlight iPhone developer frustration over a lack of communication concerning which technologies and features were forbidden from the App Store, and why.The iPhone application review process still seems a bit nebulous, but the iPhone application business itself is booming. Apple announced two weeks ago that 15,000 applications are available on the App Store, and that those applications have been downloaded 500 million times, just six months after the store opened for business."
Technology - pcworld.com,"Google has adapted its Book Search for the iPhone and its own Android platform, it announced on Thursday. It joins a growing group of network operators and content providers that are putting books on mobile phones.Google originally began digitizing books to make them accessible over the Web from a PC through its Book Search service. Beginning with scanned images of the books' pages, Google used optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract and index the text to make it searchable. On a PC, someone searching for a quote is shown the high-resolution image of the corresponding page, but those pages won't easily fit on the small screen of a mobile device, so for the new service Google sends just the text, as it would for any other text on a Web page.The new service opens up mobile access to 1.5 million public domain books in the U.S., and half a million outside the U.S., Google said. The technology is still being perfected, so automatically recognized texts can include errors. If you hit 'patches where the text seems, well, weird, well, you can just tap on the text to see the original page image', Google said in a blog posting about the mobile service.Books can be searched for, or located via a number of categories, including adventure, classics and drama. Titles available on the mobile version include classics such as Oliver Twist, Shakespeare's King Henry V, The Jungle Book and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.But Google isn't the only one interested in putting books on mobile phones. Amazon is working on making titles for its popular e-book reader, the Kindle, available on a variety of mobile phones, according to the New York Times, and U.K. mobile operator 3 recently launched 'Books on the Go', which offers books in both text or audio format for between $5 and $10. The growing popularity of dedicated readers have made the mobile industry realize that there is an opportunity here -- just like it in the past has put music and games on the phone to turn it into a one-stop-shop, according to Paolo Pescatore, analyst at CCS Insight.Sponsored Resource:Ten quick fixes for the worst security nightmares Sponsored Resource:Learn more about ultra light notebooks from Asus and the best warranty in the industry. Sponsored Resource:Thinking about a new Laptop?

Technology - psp.ign.com,"January 26, 2009 - Sony Japan's latest batch of PSP colors was apparently inspired by the feelings one gets at a carnival. Set for March release in the Nippon is the new Carnival Color series of PSP-3000 systems, offering players a gaudy array of colors to make sure people can recognize them as a PSP owner from a mile away. The series consists of four colors: Vibrant Blue, Radiant Red, Bright Yellow, and Spirited Green. As you can see in our media section, the adjectives are pretty spot on. These could be some of the brightest system colors ever (excluding special Nintendo systems with the word Pikachu in the name, of course). Blue and Red will arrive on March 5, with Yellow and Green following two weeks later on March 19. As usual for Japanese PSP hardware, buyers will be able to select from a standalone unit or a Value Pack. The standalone unit, costing 19,800 yen, includes the system, an AC adapter, and a 1200mAh battery pack. The Value Pack, priced at 24,800 yen, adds in a 4 GB Memory Stick Pro Duo (Mark 2), a matching pouch, a strap, and a cloth. Sony says the Value Pack is a limited edition item. Those who want to make sure they have accessories to match the new system needn't worry. Coinciding with the various hardware releases, Sony will make available 2200mAh battery packs with like-colored shells at 5,500 yen. The special colored pouches from the Value Packs will also be sold separately, at 1,800 yen each. Sony and Koei are teaming up to give players an early shot at getting the new hardware. The Japanese release of Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce will be accompanied by a hardware bundle combining the new Radiant Red system with a copy of the game and an original soft case. Pricing for the bundle is set at 24,840 yen, or about the same price as one of the Radiant Red Value Packs. As with Strikeforce, the bundle will be released on February 26, meaning buyers will get to show off their exclusive PSP color for a full week. These colors and the Strikeforce hardware bundle are currently Japan only items. We'll of course let you know if Sony decides to bring some carnival cheer our way."
Technology - technewsworld.com,"Both Steve Jobs and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL)  are unique -- well, almost -- in the technology market. Most companies spend their money on lots of product choices and hope to hit a sweet spot for a customer; Apple spends its money on marketing and design and drives customers to the sweet spot it creates. Most CEOs focus on financial performance , investors and big customers; Steve Jobs focuses on design, product presentation and driving employees and suppliers like cattle, leaving the traditional CEO roles largely to others. Apple and Steve Jobs are deeply intertwined, with no evidence of any real life outside or after Apple for Jobs, and no real successor to Jobs for Apple.Let's explore that this week in the context of the last time I saw this -- in the '70s with Disney (NYSE: DIS) -- and close with my product of the week, a book on how to answer the ultimate question about business. Comparing Apple to Disney I've been doing a lot of coverage regarding Steve Jobs' announcement that he would step down and believe the odds are against him coming back. This has resulted in a long look at the other companies I've covered over the years and the realization that I've only really seen one truly like Apple. Bill Gates, while similar, stopped being the key product pitchman for Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)  some time before he left, and he eased out of the role. This forced me to look back farther, and I landed at Disney, which, while Walt was still there, had a unique magic much like Apple does that goes beyond what it was and goes to what folks imagined it to be.Walt Disney was the human personification of the Disney Corp., and what drove this home was seeing him on television every Sunday and many of the times Disneyland was pitched. In addition, he often personally pitched the movies his company made, much like Jobs generally pitches the products Apple makes.Disney, like Jobs, was a known fixture at both Disneyland and the Disney studio and seemed to find a way to touch most of the employees. It was his vision that created both Disneyland and Walt Disney World, though the latter wasn't completed until after his death.But when he died, the Disney we knew died with him. It took a few years for some of his ideas to work through the pipeline, but I'm sure many didn't end up the way he had intended and the success of the company declined until a failed hostile takeover and breakup resulted in a new management team and a new Disney.Disney now is a media giant, but I think it lacks much of the magic it had while Walt was there. The best example of this was the need to buy Pixar (Nasdaq: PIXR)  for a massive amount of money in order to, once again, bring out the kind of product that Disney built the company on.If Disney ever wanted to capture the greatness it once had, it might make sense to put someone from Pixar in a role that facilitated their imagination and vision to flow across more of the properties. But what would be the equivalent of a Pixar for Apple? Steve Jobs the Face of Apple Like Disney was under Walt, Apple is a unique company under Steve Jobs. This is most deeply detailed it the book Inside Steve's Brain, which I recommended folks read last year. While it isn't unusual for a CEO to focus on things they know and delegate many of the responsibilities other CEOs have, it is unusual for a CEO to take the path that Steve Jobs did.Carly Fiorina came close with regard to making herself the visible face of HP (NYSE: HPQ)  and aggressively attempting to remove the images of the founders, but while she did drive HP's vision, she didn't get intimate with the products nor did she drive people to perform at a deep level in the company. Why Steve Is Unique In Apple, there is a unique term: 'Steve'd', which is when Steve fires someone he is upset with on the spot. He has a history of going down to the individual worker and scaring them with termination to get the results he wants, and at no other company I follow is fear used as effectively.This goes beyond employees. I met with an ex-Apple vendor at CES last week and they told the story of how Steve had demanded they redesign a chip and put it into production in a few weeks. They tried to explain that even if they hand carried and expedited everything it would take at least 90 days to design the part, validate the design, build a prototype, test it, and then create a manufacturing line to build the new part. He told them that if they didn't meet his schedule he would never do business with them again. It was physically impossible to meet his demands and yet he pulled all his business from the vendor. Vendors are scared half to death they will be 'Steve'd.'But he even personally gets involved with competitors. Upon learning that HP was bringing out an MP3 player, he personally called Carly Fiorina and offered to allow her to build an HP-branded iPod, promising to let HP have the colors it wanted (as long as they didn't make the iPod look bad), and that Apple would work with HP to develop transcoding so the device would work with Windows Media files (HP is a Windows vendor, after all).After the deal was struck, he notified HP that only white was appropriate for an iPod and never allowed transcoding, but the contract still locked HP out of the MP3 player market until Apple dominated it. Effectively, Steve Jobs 'Steve'd,' HP and people there are still pissed. Right or wrong, it worked -- and this personal involvement is unique in any market for a CEO. How Steve Assures Perceived Quality Steve assures the products from the original design concept all the way through the final presentation. Or at least did. He thinks about how he will present a product, and that is why you got stunning designs like the first and current iPod nano, and it is likely he wasn't that involved in the third generation of that product because it didn't present well (and why Apple redesigned it for the current generation).He is known to spend hours making sure, upon the first presentation of a product, that the lighting is just right and that the product is positioned just so and seems to have a natural sense for how to showcase a product in its best light. Steve Is Unique and Will Be Missed In the end, what probably makes Steve Jobs unique is that unlike any other, he is more of a product manager with CEO authority than a typical CEO, which makes him almost impossible to replicate.So, like Disney without Walt, Apple simply won't be Apple without Steve because he is the guy who crafts Apple's image and the image of its products to customers, vendors and employees. Without him, Apple would need to become more like a more common company and, recall, it tried that once before and it didn't end well. We'll see; in any case, let's hope Steve gets better or the Apple board figures out a good plan B, or maybe both. The Apple board didn't do its job and Steve shouldn't be in the position he is in, but that is for another day; for now let's just think about the wonder that is Steve Jobs. Book of the Week: Answering the Ultimate Question Part of what makes Apple the company they are is the near-rabid loyalty of its customer fan base. What companies like EMC (NYSE: EMC)  are learning is that customers come in a lot of flavors, ranging from the ones who will do anything for you to the ones that demand the lowest price and run you into the red, milking you for everything they can get.If there were a way to get more of the former and encourage the latter to switch to a competitor, this would go a long way toward creating a company with the kind of loyalty Apple enjoys. The book Answering the Ultimate Question: How Net Promoter Can Transform Your Business by Richard Owen and Laura L. Brooks does a great job explaining how to use NPS (Net Promoter Score) to increase customer loyalty and improve the bottom line.It's my pick of the week because, in this economy, we all need to be focused like lasers on the bottom line."

Technology - wired.com,"In November, not two weeks after winning the election and still two months from becoming commander in chief, Barack Obama brought the government into the 21st century. Or at least that was what we were told when he released his first Web video address as president-elect. The clip, billed by some as a modern fireside chat, was embedded as a YouTube video on Change.gov, the incoming administration's Web site. Sitting in a leather chair, framed slightly off center from his chest up, Obama delivered a three-minute talk on the economic crisis, vlog style.The video quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of views, and within a few days hundreds of blogs were linking to it. Obama's foray into viral video, the story went, heralded the beginning of a new era in government communication and transparency''Franklin Roosevelt 2.0,' in the words of The Huffington Post. The Washington Post proclaimed the advent of the 'YouTube presidency.'It wasn't long, however, before savvy observers noted what was missing from this and other Obama videos: the chance for ordinary citizens to talk back. The campaign initially disabled the comment function on YouTube and prevented response videos from appearing alongside. A YouTube video without comments, some pundits groused, is more like a monologue than a chat, fireside or not. 'I don't see how one-way messages provide any more transparency for the work of the White House or government than the current old-style radio addresses,' blogged Ellen Miller, director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government-transparency watchdog group. 'Is Obama ready,' challenged TechCrunch, 'to be a two-way president?'Of course, Obama's transition team had good reasons for disabling responses. For starters, YouTube comments are typically the intellectual equivalent of truck-stop graffiti. (When the team belatedly allowed comments a couple of weeks later, the site was flooded with insights like 'USA susks.') Also, his team would have zero control over the potentially critical or embarrassing response videos that users would post next to the address. The real reason, however, was that Obama wasn't actually trying to have a conversation with Americans via YouTube. Like every president before him, he was simply harnessing the latest tools to talk to them, one-way.Technophiles who watched the campaign closely expected more, and now they are putting pressure on the White House to govern with unparalleled transparency and citizen interaction. Dan Froomkin of the Niemen Watchdog Journalism Project and The Washington Post summed up expectations in a blog post calling for Obama to embrace 'wiki culture' in which 'major policy proposals have public collaborative workspaces.'Obama has himself to blame for raising such expectations. During the campaign, he embraced every form of social media. At My.BarackObama.com, supporters could create profiles, talk to each other, and by election dayplan some 200,000 offline dinners and living room fund-raisers. Users could log in from home to get lists of swing-state voters to telephone; this generated 3 million calls in the final four days of the race. Those efforts were combined with massive database-crunching to identify potential voters who could be approached door-to-door by last-minute canvassers, myself included.As for John McCain's efforts, well, he didn't really have any. According to Andrew Rasiej and Micah Sifry, cofounders of the Personal Democracy Forum and the blog TechPresident, Obama had four times the number of Facebook supporters, 24 times the Twitter devotees, and three times the visitors to his site in the final campaign week. The public watched about 15 million hours of Obama campaign videos on YouTube. Along the way, Obama collected 13 million email addresses, more than a million cell phone numbers, and a"
